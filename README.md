# Tic Tac Toe

This is a late-term assignment in a Software engineering course at The University of Reykjavík. The assignment mostly revolves around setting up a technical infrastructure to support agile development. The main challage is to glue together the bits and pieces through the latter half of the class's curriculum, into a coherent infrastructure. We are working in a group of six students are we're implementing a simple game of TicTacToe using the methods we've been tought on agile development. The main focus of this project is therefore on the infrastructure and the best coding practices but not on the implemented features of the game itself.

### About Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a game between two players where they compete to get three consecutive symbols (x's or o's) on a 3x3 playing board. The board is marked with numbers from 1 to 9 and the players take turns choosing on which square they want to place their symbol. As soon as a player decides which square from 1 to 9 they want to place their symbol on, that square becomes marked with their symbol and can no longer be used, the other player then takes their turned following the same pattern of rules. The first player to get three consecutive symbols (across the table or diagonal) wins the game. If the board fills up with symbols and neither player has three consecutive ones, there is a tie.
